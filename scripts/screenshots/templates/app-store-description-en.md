## Description

30 unread books on your shelf. How many years have you been saying "I'll read it next"?
Tsundoku makes you put your money where your bookmark is.
If you don't finish, your pledge becomes a donation to children's literacy.

■ How It Works

① Pick a book — Search via Google Books or scan the barcode
② Set a deadline and stakes — $7 to $70
③ Read or donate — Finish on time and nothing happens. Miss your deadline, and your pledge goes to Room to Read

■ Why It Works

Willpower alone: 23% completion rate.
With a financial commitment: 87%.
Built on the behavioral economics principle of "commitment devices."

■ Features

・Monk Mode — Focus timer with ambient sounds. No notifications. Just you and the book
・Reading DNA — Analyze your reading patterns. Morning reader? Night owl? Current streak?
・Hall of Fame — A beautiful gallery of every book you've finished
・Lifeline — Genuinely busy month? Extend your deadline by 7 days
・Job Rankings — See what professionals in your field are reading

■ Who It's For

・You have 10+ unread books
・You know reading matters, but can't stick with it
・You want reading to be a real habit, not a New Year's resolution
・You'd rather your failure fund a child's education than go to waste

■ About Donations

All penalty payments go directly to Room to Read, an NPO providing literacy and education to children in developing countries. Your unfinished book becomes someone's first book.
