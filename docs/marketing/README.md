## Waitlist Implementation

### Option A: Tally Forms (Recommended)
1. Create free account at [tally.so](https://tally.so)
2. Use Titan color palette (#1A1008 background, #FF6B35 accent)
3. Add fields: Email (required), Name (optional), Unread books count, Reading motivation
4. Copy form URL: `tally.so/r/commit-waitlist`

### Option B: Custom Web Portal
**Note**: The Web Portal repository (`commit-app-web`) appears to be managed separately. If implementing a custom waitlist page:

1. Navigate to the Web Portal repository (likely a separate Git repo)
2. Create `app/waitlist/page.tsx` (Next.js App Router)
3. Implement form with email capture
4. Deploy to Vercel: `npx vercel --prod --yes`
5. Use the implementation example in [quick-start.md](./quick-start.md) Section 2
