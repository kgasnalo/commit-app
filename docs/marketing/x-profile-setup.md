## Common Profile Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Do This
- **Generic bio**: "Passionate about reading. Love books. Follow me!"
  - Problem: No value proposition, no CTA
- **No profile photo**: Using default egg icon
  - Problem: Looks untrustworthy, low engagement
- **Broken website link**: Link that 404s or goes to wrong page
  - Problem: Lost conversions, unprofessional
- **Protected account**: Private tweets
  - Problem: Can't build audience, tweets don't show in search
- **Inconsistent branding**: Profile photo doesn't match product
  - Problem: Confusing, less memorable

### ✅ Do This Instead
- **Clear value bio**: "Building Commit. Turn reading goals into reality. 🚀 Beta soon."
- **Professional photo**: Commit logo or high-quality headshot
- **Working link**: Tested on mobile, leads to waitlist
- **Public account**: Tweets visible to all
- **Consistent branding**: Logo, colors, tone match product
